LICS is a program which takes your sentence and replaces words in it so that if you were read it without a phonetic element, it would be almost impossible to understand.
** Why?
Like this, it is much harder for a computer to detect what you are typing, but it still allows others to make out what your trying to communicate.
** WHY?!
As the name says, it is supposed to be counter-survailence measure. Wanna evade government and commercial dragnets? Protect your privacy? Keep communication a bit more private?

* Ok... How?!
We have 3 flavours of lics:
+ 👿
+ CLI
+ GUI

To use these, download the repository and follow the instructions below or simply use the scripts.
** Daemon
The best way to go about usin the daemon is to use a key-binding on your machine to trigger the script. This is best done on linux.
