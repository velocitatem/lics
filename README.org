Protect hoar messages frum canning bae a computer. Protect hoar privacy.

Did I just have a stroak? No. (Thanks for asking)

* Hut his this' (What is this?)
LICS is a program which takes your sentence and replaces words in it so that if you were read it without a phonetic element, it would be almost impossible to understand.
** Why?
Like this, it is much harder for a computer to detect what you are typing, but it still allows others to make out what your trying to communicate.
** WHY?!
As the name says, it is supposed to be counter-survailence measure. Wanna evade government and commercial dragnets? Protect your privacy? Keep communication a bit more private?

* Ok... How?!
